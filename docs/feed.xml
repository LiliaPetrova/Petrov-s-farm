&lt;p&gt;We understand the importance of the health of our livestock, the preservation of the land that feeds us, and the well-being of the people who help us bring our product to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We treat our flock with the utmost respect and work diligently to promote whole animal butchery as to not waste the precious resources of food and fiber that they have given us.&lt;/p&gt;
