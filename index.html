    <p>We have been sheep farmers in Bulgaria since 1900 with a foundation flock of Avasi and Asaf sheep. Both side of our families have a long and notable history of raising sheep. Since before the turn of the 20th century, we have been providing breeding stock, meat lambs, and support to the sheep industry. For us, family farming means sustainable farming.. With its beautiful, sprawling fields and woodlands, we are committed to keeping our property a working part of the rural landscape, offering a bounty of products that allow us to harvest or recycle to the highest degree possible.
      As our farm continues to grow, the quality of our products will always be extremely important to both of us. Whether it be lamb, dairy, wool, pork, eggs, compost or honey, we work diligently to remain leaders in our industry.
